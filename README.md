# Animal Crossing: New Leaf but poorly translated (working title)
This is a (Work In Progress) poor translation of [Animal Crossing: New Leaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_New_Leaf) for the [Nintendo 3DS.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS) As of now, it's planned to just replace the text, however changing the graphics may be considered.

# Some questions, and some answers!

### What the hell is this?
Well, it's just me taking Animal Crossing: New Leaf and throwing it into Google Translate. That's it

### How do I install it?
You don't. Not yet, at least. But, once it's made avalible, then I'll provide instructions on how to mess up Animal Crossing and have it make no sense at all. Just make sure you have a [hacked 3DS](https://3ds.hacks.guide) with [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS) insatlled. **:>**

### How will you go about making this publically avalible?
At first, I'll do pre-releases, each of them containing one file that has been translated (I.E. The frst pre-relese will have `SYS_2D_UI.umsbt`, while the next may have another one). After all the text files have been poorly translated, the first offical release will be.. well, released. After that, I'll turn my attention to changing the graphics, which will take more time. After all graphics are complete, I'll consider making a `.cia` release, with a different TitleID to Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo (EUR) (You'll be able to use it on any region, though). The `.cia` release may not be public for a while, however this is still up in the air.

### Why is there nothing?
It's nowhere near done. At all. I haven't even done the UI yet. But, once I've done the UI, there will be more than a README.md, that's for sure.

### I have a suggestion, where should I put it?
Any and all suggestions are welcome! Just make a [new Issue](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/issues/new) with the `enhancement` tag. Don't be vauge, though.

### Why is it taking so long for something to get done?
I'm the only one working on this, as a hobby. It's for fun, and nothing more. Plus, basiaclly everything is self taught. Of couse, with one person working on changing all the text in a text heavy game like Animal Crossing: New Leaf, it's gonna take a while for things to get done. Not to mention, it also depends on my mood for that day (or if I've burnt myself out or not). 

# Documentation
I do plan to document the prosess so that others can do not just text hacks, but also ROM hacks for Animal Crossing: New Leaf. As of right now, that documentation doesn't exist.

# That's it
You can get on with your day now. **:>**
