# Animal Crossing: New Leaf translated
This is a (Work In Progress) poor translation of Animal Crossing: New Leaf for the Nintendo 3DS. As of now, it's planned to just replace the text, however changing the graphics may be considers.

# Some questions, and answers!

### What the hell is this?
Well, it's just me taking Animal Crossing: New Leaf and throwing it into Google Translate. That's it

### How do I install it?
You don't. Not yet, at least. But, once it's made avalible, then I'll provide instructions on how to mess up Animal Crossing and have it make no sense at all. **:>**

### Why is there nothing?
It's nowhere near done. At all. I haven't even done the UI yet. But, once I've done the UI, there will be more than a README.md, that's for sure.

### I have a suggestion, where should I put it?
Any and all suggestions are welcome! Just make a [new Issue](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/issues/new) with the `enhancement` tag. Don't be vauge, though.


# Documentation
I do plan to document the prosess so that others can do not just text hacks, but also ROM hacks for Animal Crossing: New Leaf. As of right now, that documentation doesn't exist.

# That's it
You can get on with your day now. **:>**
