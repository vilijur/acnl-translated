# Animal Crossing: New Leaf but poorly translated (working title)
This is a (Work In Progress) poor translation of [Animal Crossing: New Leaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_New_Leaf) for the [Nintendo 3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS) [console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console). As of now, it's planned to just replace the text, however changing the graphics may be considered.

# ⚠**WARNING**⚠
This mod was made based off of Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo (EUR), and as such, the Title ID in the `luma` folder is for that game. If you do not have Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo (EUR), you can change the Title ID to the version of your game, however this may cause more unexpected issues. **PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK**

# Some questions, and some answers!

### What the hell is this?
Well, it's just me taking Animal Crossing: New Leaf and throwing it into [Google Translate](https://translate.google.co.uk/). That's it

### How do I install it?
**Since this is a modification of the European/PAL files, these instructions will assume you're using the European/PAL version of Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo.**
**If `Enable game patching` is already enabled, skip step 1**

1. Make sure you have a [hacked 3DS](https://3ds.hacks.guide) with [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS) installed. If your 3DS is on, turn it off, then press and hold `SELECT`, then press the power button. You should be in the [Luma3DS configuration screen.](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/wiki/Optional-features) Press down on the `D-Pad` once, then press `A`. This will turn on `Enable game patching`, assuming it hasn't been enabled yet (You'll know if it's enabled if `(x)` is shown before `Enable game patching`.). Press `START` to save, then turn off the 3DS. Remove your SD Card from your 3DS and insert it into your computer.

2. Download the `.zip` file from the latest [pre-release](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/releases), and extract it to the root of your SD Card. If it asks to merge, select yes. Allow it to replace any files, if asked. Then, insert your SD Card back into your 3DS.

3. Start up `Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo`. If the menu says `According to Ⓐ`, you're done! Enjoy the unfinished translated mess!

### How do I know if I have the Welcome amiibo release or not?
Have a look at the game's icon. If the background is **green**, you have the orginal game. If the background is **white**, you have the Welcome amiibo release. If you have the orginal game, make sure to change the Title ID in the `titles` folder found in the `zip` file to that of your game (You can find the Title ID by using [FBI](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI). Open FBI, go into Titles and look for `Animal Crossing: New Leaf`. You'll see the Title ID on the top screen.) This also applies if you're not using a Europian/PAL copy of AC:NL.

### Isn't the warning a bit too dramatic?
Yeah.

### How will you go about making this publically avalible?
At first, I'll do pre-releases, each of them containing one file that has been translated (I.E. The frst pre-relese will have `SYS_2D_UI.umsbt`, while the next may have another one). After all the text files have been poorly translated, the first offical release will be.. well, released. After that, I'll turn my attention to changing the graphics, which will take more time. After all graphics are complete, I'll consider making a `.cia` release, with a different TitleID to Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo (EUR) (You'll be able to use it on any region, though). The `.cia` release may not be public for a while, however this is still up in the air. **This plan is subject to change**

### You mention a `.cia` release. Will you change the game icon and banner?
Yes! I plan to make the banner's icon (the one you see on the top screen) the same as the poorly translated title screen graphic in game. As for the game icon on the bottom screen, I'll replace it with this:

### How long do you think it will take to finish this?
I say about a year or two minimum. Animal Crossing: New Leaf is a very text heavy game, and the `Talk` folder is scaring me with how many files there are.

### Why is some of the text is not translated?
It's nowhere near complete, and some text is in other files that have not yet been translated. Though, if something's apart of one of the avalible translated files and isn't translated, open an [Issue](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/issues/new) with the `bug` tag, provide where the text isn't translated (I.E in a menu) and I'll get to it as soon as posible.

### Some text is duplicated, why is that?
Not sure, but open an [Issue](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/issues/new) with the `bug` tag, and I'll look into it as soon as I can.

### Some of the text goes off screen or gets cut off.
Seems like I need to retranslate that part, make it shorter or reformat it. You can inform me of this by opening an [Issue](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/issues/new) with the `invalid` tag, give details on what part of the game this issue happens at, and I'll look into it as soon as I can.

### I have a suggestion, where should I put it?
Any and all suggestions are welcome! Just make a [new Issue](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/issues/new) with the `enhancement` tag. Don't be vauge, though.

### Why is it taking so long for something to get done?
I'm the only one working on this (as of now, very likely to change), as a hobby. It's for fun, and nothing more. Plus, basiaclly everything is self taught. Of coruse, with one person working on changing all the text in a text heavy game like Animal Crossing: New Leaf, it's gonna take a while for things to get done. Not to mention, it also depends on my mood for that day (or if I've burnt myself out or not). 

### How do I keep up to date on the project?

### My question isn't answered here!
If you have any questions that are not answered here, either drop me a Discord DM (vilijur#4481), Twitter DM ([@vilijur](https://twitter.com/vilijur) or [@translatijur](https://twitter.com/translatijur)), or make a [new Issue](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/issues/new) with the `question` tag (You should also add `@vilijur` in your Issue so I can get to it a little bit quicker). Keep in mind that it may take a while for me to repsond, depening on how you choose to contact me.

### What's the fastest way to contact you?
I'd say Discord would be fastest, since I use that app too much (oh god someone help me)

### What folder are you working on as of now?
Right now, I plan to tackle the `MailN` folder.

# Documentation
I do plan to document the prosess so that others can do not just text hacks, but also ROM hacks for Animal Crossing: New Leaf. As of right now, that documentation does exist but barely. You can check it out [here.](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/wiki)

# That's it
You can get on with your day now. **:>**
