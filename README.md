# Animal Crossing: New Leaf but poorly translated (working title)
This is a (Work In Progress) poor translation of [Animal Crossing: New Leaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_New_Leaf) for the [Nintendo 3DS.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS) As of now, it's planned to just replace the text, however changing the graphics may be considered.

# ⚠**WARNING**⚠
This mod was made based off of Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo (EUR), and as such, the Title ID in the `luma` folder is for that game. If you do not have Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo (EUR), you can change the Title ID to the version of your game, however this may cause more unexpected issues. **PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK**

# Some questions, and some answers!

### What the hell is this?
Well, it's just me taking Animal Crossing: New Leaf and throwing it into [Google Translate.](htttps://translate.google.co.uk) That's it

### How do I install it?
Well... I don't have this part written up yet, so give me some time while I write the instructions.

### How will you go about making this publically avalible?
At first, I'll do pre-releases, each of them containing one file that has been translated (I.E. The frst pre-relese will have `SYS_2D_UI.umsbt`, while the next may have another one). After all the text files have been poorly translated, the first offical release will be.. well, released. After that, I'll turn my attention to changing the graphics, which will take more time. After all graphics are complete, I'll consider making a `.cia` release, with a different TitleID to Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo (EUR) (You'll be able to use it on any region, though). The `.cia` release may not be public for a while, however this is still up in the air.

### You mention a `.cia` release. Will you change the game icon and banner?
Yes! I plan to make the banner's icon (the one you see on the top screen) the same as the poorly translated title screen graphic in game. As for the game icon on the bottom screen, I'm still deciding on what to do.

### Why is some of the text is not translated?
It's nowhere near complete, and some text is in other files that have not yet been translated. Though, if something's apart of one of the avalible translated files and isn't translated, open an [Issue](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/issues/new) with the `bug` tag, provide where the text isn't translated (I.E in a menu) and I'll get to it as soon as posible.

### Some text is duplicated, why is that?
Not sure, but open an [Issue](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/issues/new) with the `bug` tag, and I'll look into it as soon as I can.

### I have a suggestion, where should I put it?
Any and all suggestions are welcome! Just make a [new Issue](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/issues/new) with the `enhancement` tag. Don't be vauge, though.

### Why is it taking so long for something to get done?
I'm the only one working on this (as of now), as a hobby. It's for fun, and nothing more. Plus, basiaclly everything is self taught. Of couse, with one person working on changing all the text in a text heavy game like Animal Crossing: New Leaf, it's gonna take a while for things to get done. Not to mention, it also depends on my mood for that day (or if I've burnt myself out or not). 

### How do I keep up to date on the project?
[On my Twitter!](https://twitter.com/vilijur) (Sorry Twitter followers who have no intrest in Animal Crossing: New Leaf being thrown in the Google Translate oven)

### My question isn't answered here!
If you have any questions that are not answered here, either drop me a Discord DM (vilijur#4481), Twitter DM ([@vilijur](https://twitter.com/vilijur)), or make a [new Issue](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated/issues/new) with the `question` tag (You should also add `@vilijur` in your Issue so I can get to it a little bit quicker). Keep in mind that it may take a while for me to repsond, depening on how you choose to contact me.

# Documentation
I do plan to document the prosess so that others can do not just text hacks, but also ROM hacks for Animal Crossing: New Leaf. As of right now, that documentation doesn't exist at all in any way shape or form.

# That's it
You can get on with your day now. **:>**
